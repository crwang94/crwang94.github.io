I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the McKelvey School of Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis. I received my BSc degree in Electrical Engineering from Virginia Tech in 2017. 

My research interests focus on developing coding techniques that enhance the security and performance of real-world applications.

In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, basketball, and tennis.
